## Implemented but Not Working Properly

### **1. User Movement and Projectile Responsiveness Issue**

**Problem Description:**
- **Issue**: Player movement becomes laggy, especially in Level Three, and holding the spacebar for extended periods sometimes causes inconsistent projectile behavior (e.g., spamming or unresponsiveness).

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Input Handling Timing Issues**:
   - The `InputManager` relies on a `HashSet` for key state tracking, which may not handle rapid key presses effectively.
2. **Event Handling Conflicts**:
   - The `fireProjectile()` method tied to spacebar input might not properly regulate firing rate during extended key presses.
3. **Game Loop Processing Delays**:
   - High processing demands in Level Three may occasionally impact the responsiveness of input handling.

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. **Continuous Input Processing**:
   - Implemented the `processInput()` method in the game loop to dynamically handle key states and ensure smoother user movement.
2. **HashSet for Key Tracking**:
   - Utilized a `HashSet<KeyCode>` to track active key presses and prevent duplicate event handling.
3. **Input Timing Adjustment**:
   - Introduced a cooldown mechanism to regulate projectile firing rate by limiting how often `fireProjectile()` can trigger.

**Current Status:**
- **Outcome**: Movement issues have been resolved, but the projectile behavior remains inconsistent. Spacebar spamming sometimes results in rapid firing, while at other times, the input is not registered. Further debugging is required to fully stabilize projectile input handling.

### **2. Kill Count Logic Issue**

**Problem Description:**
- **Issue**: The kill count increases whenever an `EnemyPlane` is destroyed, regardless of the cause. This includes scenarios where the enemy exits the screen or collides with obstacles, even when the player did not directly shoot it.

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Generic Kill Event Handling**:
   - The kill count logic is tied to the destruction of `EnemyPlane` objects (`takeDamage()` or similar methods), rather than being specifically triggered by player actions.
2. **Screen Boundary Collision**:
   - Enemies exiting the screen are treated as destroyed, inadvertently triggering the kill count increment.
3. **Lack of Source Verification**:
   - The system does not verify the source of the damage or destruction event (e.g., projectile, collision, or screen boundary exit), leading to incorrect kill count increments.

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. **Event Source Validation**:
   - Added checks to determine if the enemy was destroyed by a `UserProjectile` before incrementing the kill count.
2. **Screen Exit Handling**:
   - Updated the logic for screen boundary checks to differentiate between destruction events caused by gameplay actions and natural exits.
3. **Debugging Enemy Logic**:
   - Conducted tests to ensure only valid enemy kills caused by the player contribute to the kill count.

**Current Status:**
- **Outcome**: The issue persists; enemies passing through the screen boundary still incorrectly increment the kill count. Further debugging and refinement of the screen boundary handling logic are required to resolve this behavior.

### **3. Screen Scaling and Alignment Issue**

**Problem Description:**
- **Issue**: When running the game on a laptop, the scaling of certain screens (e.g., pause screen and main menu) becomes inconsistent. The screen appears shifted to the bottom-right and does not fit properly. However, on a large monitor or with adjusted display settings, the screens align correctly.

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Scale Resolution Discrepancies**:
   - The game UI does not dynamically adapt to varying screen resolutions or DPI settings.
2. **JavaFX Scaling Limitations**:
   - JavaFX may not automatically scale UI components to fit screens with differing resolutions or scaling factors (e.g., 125%, 150% display settings).
3. **Fixed Layout Dimensions**:
   - Hardcoded dimensions for certain screens may prevent proper scaling on devices with smaller or non-standard resolutions.

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. **Dynamic Scene Sizing**:
   - Modified the scene initialization to bind the game layout dimensions to the window size dynamically using `Stage` and `Scene` resizing properties.
2. **Resolution Testing**:
   - Tested the application on multiple resolutions and DPI settings. The issue persists on smaller displays but resolves on large monitors with standard scaling (100%).
3. **Monitor Dependency**:
   - Used a large monitor with its own desktop configuration, ensuring the game scales and fits properly for all scenes.

**Current Status:**
- **Outcome**: The issue remains unresolved on laptops with smaller displays or non-standard scaling settings. To ensure proper screen alignment, the game must be run on a large monitor or the system display scaling must be reduced to 100%. Further adjustments to dynamic scaling logic are required for a permanent fix.

## Features Not Implemented

### **1. Multiplayer Mode**

**Feature Description:**
- **Objective:**  
  Introduce a multiplayer mode to allow players to compete or cooperate in real-time. This feature would enable peer-to-peer gameplay, supporting modes such as cooperative survival or competitive high-score challenges.

**Challenges Encountered:**
1. **Networking Complexity:**
   - **Issue:** Developing a reliable and low-latency networking system for real-time multiplayer interaction proved challenging.
   - **Impact:** Synchronizing game states across players in different locations required robust server logic and extensive testing.
2. **User Interface Adjustments:**
   - **Issue:** Adding multiplayer required significant changes to the user interface, including a lobby system, player indicators, and chat support.
   - **Impact:** These adjustments increased the development workload, potentially impacting the overall polish of the single-player experience.

**Reasons for Leaving Out:**
- **Time Constraints:** Developing a functional and polished multiplayer mode required substantial time, which was redirected to enhancing single-player features.
- **Resource Limitations:** Multiplayer implementation required additional server infrastructure, increasing both development and maintenance costs.
- **Focus on Core Gameplay:** The initial release prioritized a rich single-player experience, with multiplayer planned for future iterations or expansions.
